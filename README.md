Alfred workflow to insert text from Accordance Bible app
Opens the Accordance Bible app and inserts Bible passages based on user input. The script is set up to use NRSV and CEB translations (if installed in Accordance), but any version(s) can be added by editing the Apple Script in step 2. Call the script by activating Alfred and then typing something like "NRS Mat 1:1-10" or "CEB Gen 5:1-7" and the script will open Accordance, copy the selected reference in the version indicated, and paste directly into the active window.
